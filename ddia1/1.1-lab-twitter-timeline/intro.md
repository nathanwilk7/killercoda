# Prerequisites

You should read the Preface and Chapter 1 (Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications) of Designing Data-Intensive Applications before completing this lab. See the [Intro](https://killercoda.com/nathanwilk7/course/ddia1/intro) for where you can purchase a copy.

Note that on the free Killercoda plan, you only get 60 minutes (1 hour) to complete the lab before you'll have to restart. Please consider supporting Killercoda by upgrading to their Plus membership as I couldn't do this without their platform and great work.
