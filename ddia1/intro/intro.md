# Goal

Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA) is often recommended as the single best resource for software engineers to increase their technical knowledge. This book helps readers design and build more complex systems. I personally love the book and agree that the ideas and principles taught within it are essential to understand and internalize. However, I’ve found that it's possible to read the book without fully understanding and internalizing the key concepts from it and thus be unable to apply them to actual systems being designed and built. My goal with creating this interactive course to the book is to enable those who want to deeply understand the book to do so in a way that essentially guarantees that they can really internalize and apply the ideas from it. This course will go into more detail on how to use real-life systems than the book and will have more interactive/hands-on exercises/labs.

Note, this page is easier to read if you use expand the text part of the page so it takes up more room than the terminal.

# Setup

This interactive course to the DDIA book has questions and labs based on the concepts taught in the book. I also provide flashcards for the questions and labs. I may provide video or audio resources at some future date as well. Note that you should not attempt this course without the book/ebook/etc. The following link has a collection of ways to buy the book in various forms: https://dataintensive.net/buy.html. I would suggest buying the print book and/or the ebook. The audiobook is excellent and I highly recommend using it as a review resource, but I think most people would be best served by using the print/ebook version to read the first time through and then using the audiobook for review. Please support [Dr. Martin Kleppmman](https://martin.kleppmann.com) by purchasing the book legally and consider contributing to his Patreon as well!

# Audience/Prereqs

This course is intended for software engineers, data engineers, distributed systems engineers, etc. who have some professional/industry knowledge/experience and have experience building web/network applications/services and are familiar with relational databases/SQL. To do the labs in this course, you’ll need to know basic shell usage, Python, and SQL. Most of the labs will use open-source software (OSS), but some may use cloud systems (e.g.: AWS), though I expect to have the cloud systems usage be low enough to be on the free-tier.

TODO update this when I’ve got a few sections written with what I’m assuming people know.

# Outline

TODO copy from end of preface

# Next

TODO should text-only be on blog but labs are on killercoda? or consolidate things more? I think only labs on killercoda and rest on blog

TODO mention that killercoda says to use chrome or edge browser (not safari).

This introduction was a text-only intro, continue to the next scenario to begin an interactive lab exploring reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
