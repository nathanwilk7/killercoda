# Goal

Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA) is often recommended as the single best resource for software engineers to increase their technical knowledge. This book will help readers design and build more complex systems. I personally love the book and agree that the ideas and principles taught within it are essential to understand and internalize. However, I’ve found that some people who read the book do not fully understand and internalize the key concepts from it and thus are unable to apply them to the actual systems they are designing and building. My goal with creating this interactive course to the book is to enable those who want to deeply understand the book to do so in a way that essentially guarantees that they can really internalize and apply the ideas from it. This course will go into more detail on how to use real-life systems than the book and will have more on interactive/hands-on exercises/labs.

# Setup

This interactive course to the DDIA book has questions and labs based on the concepts taught in the book. I also provide flashcards for the questions and labs. I may provide video or audio resources at some future date as well. Note that you should not attempt this course without the book/ebook/etc. The following link has a collection of ways to buy the book in various forms: https://dataintensive.net/buy.html. I would suggest buying the print book and/or the ebook. The audiobook is excellent and I highly recommend using it as a review resource, but I don’t think most people would benefit from listening only to the audiobook instead of reading the book/ebook as the content of many chapters requires seeing it to learn it the first time.

# Audience/Prereqs

This course is intended for software engineers, data engineers, distributed systems engineers, etc. who have some professional/industry knowledge/experience and have experience building web/network applications/services and are familiar with relational databases/SQL. To do the labs in this course, you’ll need to know basic shell usage (note I’m using zsh on macOS with an “Apple silicon” chip, so if the labs don’t work on your machine, [let me know](https://www.notion.so/About-Me-279d80f3b51b4a86987ce04d1dd82b5b?pvs=21) and we may need to adapt the lab to work for you), how to run Python programs, install Python packages, run Docker images, and write SQL queries. Most of the labs will use open-source software (OSS), but some will use cloud systems (e.g.: AWS), though I expect to have the cloud systems usage be low enough to be on the free-tier.

TODO update this when I’ve got a few sections written with what I’m assuming people know.

# Next

This introduction was a text-only intro, continue to the next section to begin an interactive lab exploring reliability, scalability, and maintainability.
